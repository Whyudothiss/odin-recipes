       <p>Simple yet delicious recipe of a classic italian dish</p>

       <p><h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3></p>

       <p><ul>
         <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
         <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
         <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
         <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
         <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
         <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
         <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
       </ul></p>

       <p><h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3></p>
       
       <p><ol>
         <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.</li>
         <li>While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
         <li>Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta. Pour in hot olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until combined.</li.>
         <li>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
